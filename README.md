This is the new tool I made to edit the origin points and scales of UVs in meshes and export them as new meshes in editor time. This was made to make it easier to use color atlasses with meshes and generate multiple versions as they are needed without having to go back and forth between Unity and modelling softwares. It displays the current texture the model has along with the vertex placements of the current UV and allows you visually select a new origin point, you can also use the numeric input field or the zoomed in visual below the main texture for precise editing. It uses the Unity Fbx Exporter package to output a new fbx directly into your project. The package also includes a config file that allows you to change the color and size of indicators displayed on the texture.
You have to press the ""Get Initial UVs" buttons before making any changes for the tool to cache the required data.
Please note that the "Read/Write" import setting of your texture must be enabled for the preview to work. 
It should also be noted that the tool is meant for use in edit time and stores a not insignificant amount of vertex data while being used so remember to remove the UV Editor components from your scenes before building your projects.
